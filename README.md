# China OSINT
Collection of online sources of information aiding researchers in investigating China.

The aim of this project is to aid researchers looking to further enhance their investigations into China.

As we all know, China is a tough country to investigate and look into. Sometimes, simply getting news from the country is hard. You don't know where to begin.

Thus, China OSINT.

We will be collecting sources of information covering China and including them here in this repo.

Enjoy browsing!

## How Sources Are Organized
There are three categories of "perspectives" from which you will gather information:
- Chinese perspective (Beijing, Hong Kong and Taipei perspectives)
- Regional perspectives (Australia, Singapore, Japan, etc.)
- International perspectives (USA, Germany, UK, etc.)

In the future, there will be more sources of information gathered and put here in this repo.
